<h3>10/01/14</h3>
<p>
	I've finally figured out how this works kind of. It's a little hard to wrap my head around but I'm learning. I now know how to change fonts, separate divs, add photos, and use hover. I don't  know how to put my site online though :(. My ultimate goal is to make a digital magic sheet for the Martin Theater.

	To save and publish my changes online I am going to do the following:

	<br>
	Go to the terminal and if it's a new window, I type:

<br>

	cd ./desktop/Teddy-25w.github.io

	<br>

	git add .

	<br>
	git commit -m "add message"

	<br>
	git push
</p>
