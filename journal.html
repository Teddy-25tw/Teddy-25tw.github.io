	I've finally figured out how this works kind of. It's a little hard to wrap my head around but I'm learning. I now know how to change fonts, separate divs, add photos, and use hover. I don't  know how to put my site online though :(. My ultimate goal is to make a digital magic sheet for the Martin Theater.
